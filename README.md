These Python codes encompasses simple fluid plasma drift wave implementations. 

The driftwave.py is simple electron drift wave with Boltzmann electrons. This 
works quite well.

The driftwave_ionparallel.py includes parallel momentum and heat equations. 
This might still be a bit buggy. If you find mistakes, let us know.
